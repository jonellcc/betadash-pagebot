    <h1>BelugaBot Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: October 26, 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Please review this privacy policy thoroughly.</strong> Your privacy is very important to us, and we are dedicated to safeguarding the information you share when using BelugaBot. This policy outlines how we manage your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>BelugaBot uses trusted third-party services for specific functions such as text processing and image generation. These third-party providers include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>OpenAI</strong> for text processing and image generation (<a href="https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These services process your data temporarily to complete your requests and do not store any information beyond what is necessary for task completion.</p>

    <h2>4. Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Your data is solely used to process requests sent to BelugaBot. We do not utilize your data for marketing, analytics, or any purposes beyond the immediate task.</p>

    <h2>5. Security Measures</h2>
    <p>Although BelugaBot does not retain any data, we ensure that the third-party services we utilize implement stringent security measures, including encryption, to protect your data during transmission.</p>

    <h2>6. User Rights</h2>
    <p>Since we do not store personal data, traditional data rights such as access or deletion requests do not apply. However, if you have concerns regarding data processing, feel free to contact us for further details on third-party services used.</p>

    <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>BelugaBot is not intended for children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe your child has used BelugaBot and shared information, please reach out, and we will ensure their data is protected.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>BelugaBot does not store any data. All interactions are processed and discarded immediately, with no logs, histories, or user profiles retained.</p>

    <h2>9. Cookies and Tracking</h2>
    <p>BelugaBot does not use cookies or tracking mechanisms. We do not track user behavior or usage patterns. However, third-party services like OpenAI may have their own cookie policies, which you should review on their websites.</p>

    <h2>10. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in our practices or for legal or regulatory reasons. Significant changes will be communicated accordingly, and the "Effective Date" at the top of this page will be updated.</p>
